# FAT - Fake but Amazing Terminal

Operating Systems 2021/2022 project

Project requirements:
```
Implement a file system that uses a pseudo "FAT" on an mmapped buffer.
The functions to implement are

    createFile
    eraseFile
    write (potentially extending the file boundaries)
    read
    seek
    createDir
    eraseDir
    changeDir
    listDir
 
The opening of a file should return a "FileHandle" that stores the position in a file.
```
